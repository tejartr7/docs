# Themes

**IndieLaunch** uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for its components. This library offers a wide range of pre-built, customizable components that are ready to use right out of the box.

You can easily update the color theme by modifying the `globals.css` file to match your desired look and feel.
